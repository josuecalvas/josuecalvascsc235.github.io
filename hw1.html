    <pre> <strong>Tyler, The Creator by Luis 'Panch' Perez for Robb Report</strong></pre>
    <h2 style="font-family:'Courier New'">Who is he?</h2>
    <p>

        Starting off as a teen in the late 2000's, <em> Tyler, The Creator </em> is not the same artist he was when
        he
        first joined the underground scene; with the founding of the collective known as <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odd_Future"> Odd Future <sup> [1] </sup> </a>. The now 31 year old
        is
        now a two-time grammy winner and a highly respected artist who has been shattering the glass ceiling time
        and
        time again. Whether it be through fashion, music, or fragrances Tyler, the Creator is not a force to be
        reckoned
        with.
    <p> <br>
    <h2 style="font-family:'Courier New'"> Fashion?</h2>
    <blockquote><em>“Don't be scared of color.”</em></blockquote>

    <p> Since he first launched into the world of clothing with his brand <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odd_Future">OFWGKTA <sub>[2]</sub></a> has changed the game
        multiple times; whether it be with his popularization of the box logo tee or the craze over anything
        donut
        related; Tyler seems to know what people will like. More recently though, he has been creating an
        entirely
        different game. The once donut logo sporting artist, has stepped into the world of luxury, popularizing
        the
        classic old money look, with his own spin on it. With loafers, and cardigans Tyler has created an empire
        based on the 80's look of LaCoste and other luxury brands, reviving the love of classics to a fashion
        world
        over-saturated with 'hype'. Always focused on working for himself instead of the middle-man, Tyler has
        built
        his own business with his vision, when the world tells him <var>1+1=2</var> he overcomes expectations
        and
        denies the laws of math.
        <!--fake quote for laughs--> Tyler the Creator wanted to share his favorite piece of python code from
        esteemed
        head professor of computer science at Converse, Dr. Peter Brown: <br> <code>from pythonds3.graphs import Graph
from pythonds3.basic import Queue

def build_graph(filename):
    buckets = {}
    the_graph = Graph()
    with open(filename, "r", encoding="utf8") as file_in:
        all_words = file_in.readlines()
    # create buckets of words that differ by 1 letter
    for line in all_words:
        word = line.strip()
        for i, _ in enumerate(word):
            bucket = f"{word[:i]}_{word[i + 1 :]}"
            buckets.setdefault(bucket, set()).add(word)

    # add edges between different words in the same bucket
    for similar_words in buckets.values():
        for word1 in similar_words:
            for word2 in similar_words - {word1}:
                the_graph.add_edge(word1, word2)
    return the_graph

def main():
    g:Graph = build_graph('wordlist.txt')
    g.reset_distances()
    g.bfs(g.get_vertex('sage')) # Actually sets shortest distances from "sage"
    g.traverse('sage', 'fool')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
    import sys
    sys.exit()</code> .
